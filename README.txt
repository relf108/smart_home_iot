The "edge_servers" folder separates the code that runs on each Raspbian VM edge server, with the pyduino.py file being shared for all edge servers.
The "cloud_server" folder holds the code used on the Raspbian VM edge server.
The "arduino" folder has the sketch that is used on every Arduino. There are no Arduinos with unique sketches.
